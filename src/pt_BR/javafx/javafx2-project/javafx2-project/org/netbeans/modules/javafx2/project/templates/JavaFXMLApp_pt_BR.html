    <b>Cria uma nova aplicação JavaFX com FXML ativado</b> em um projeto padrão do IDE. O FXML permite script, uma linguagem de marcação baseada em XML para a construção de gráficos de objetos Java. Ele fornece uma alternativa apropriada para criar tais gráficos em códigos procedurais e é ideal para definir a interface do usuário de uma aplicação JavaFX, uma vez que a estrutura hierárquica de um documento XML corresponde fielmente à estrutura do gráfico de cenário do JavaFX.
