product.description=Fornece melhor tempo de resposta e uma inicializa\u00e7\u00e3o mais r\u00e1pida ao ativar as funcionalidades instaladas somente quando elas s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias. \u00c9 o equil\u00edbrio perfeito entre riqueza de funcionalidades e baixo consumo de mem\u00f3ria/CPU. Caso a mem\u00f3ria/CPU n\u00e3o seja um recurso limitado na sua m\u00e1quina, sinta-se \u00e0 vontade para desativar este item e obter de uma s\u00f3 vez toda a funcionalidade do NetBeans IDE.
