RequiredProjectsPanel.jLabel1.text=<html>Additional Eclipse projects need to be imported to satisfy new project dependencies:
MSG_NoSourceRootsFound=No source roots have been found and therefore no classpath will be configured.
MSG_RequiredProjectNotFound=Required project ''{0}'' cannot be found.
MSG_RequiredProjectHasNoArtifacts=Required project ''{0}'' does not provide any JAR artifacts.
MSG_TransitiveExportCannotBeResolved=Transitive export ''{0}'' cannot be resolved.
MSG_MissingClasspathEntry=Classpath entry ''{0}'' does not seems to exist.
MSG_CannotResolveClasspathEntry=Classpath entry ''{0}'' cannot be resolved.
MSG_ClasspathEntryDoesNotExist=Classpath entry ''{0}'' does not seem to exist.
MSG_CannotRemoveReference=Reference to project ''{0}'' was not successfully removed.
MSG_ReferenceToProjectNotFound=Reference to project ''{0}'' was not found and therefore could not be removed.
MSG_ReferenceNotRemoved=Reference to JAR/Folder ''{0}'' was not successfully removed.
MSG_VariableReferenceNotRemoved=Reference to variable based JAR/Folder ''{0}'' was not successfully removed.
MSG_ContainerReferenceNotRemoved=Reference to container value ''{0}'' was not successfully removed.
MSG_ExcludesWarning1=Source exclude '**/*.java' was omitted. It is recommended that you double check project excludes in the Source panel of the Project Properties dialog.
MSG_ExcludesWarning2=NetBeans does not support source includes/excludes per source root as Eclipse does. They were merged and it is recommended that you double check them in the Source panel of the Project Properties dialog.
MSG_UnsupportedContainer=Unsupported classpath container found. It will be ignored and you may need to update the NetBeans project classpath by hand. The internal name of this container is: ''{0}''
MSG_UnsupportedWebContainer=There are inter-project dependencies which could not be resolved. Importing the whole workspace could prevent this problem. (''{0}'')
MSG_CannotCreateUserLibrary=User library ''{0}'' cannot be created because the project is being imported without Eclipse workspace.
MSG_IDEVariableMismatch=IDE variable ''{0}'' is configured with value ''{1}'' but the project expects it to be ''{2}''.
MSG_IDEVariableNotFound=IDE variable ''{0}'' was not found in the workspace. Set the value in NetBeans.
MSG_WorkspaceDependentProtocol=Javadoc location cannot be resolved without Eclipse workspace. It will be ignored: ''{0}''
MSG_UnsupportedProtocol=Javadoc location contains an unsupported URL protocol which will be ignored: ''{0}''
MSG_UnsupportedJavadocLocation=Javadoc location is not valid URL and will be ignored: ''{0}''
MSG_JavadocCannotBeResolved=Javadoc location cannot be resolved: ''{0}''
MSG_ImportIssues=Import Issues
MSG_ImportFailed=Import failed due to ''{0}''. More details can be found in the IDE's log file.
MSG_ImportResults=Project ''{0}'' import results:
MSG_AlreadyImportedProjectFound=An existing NetBeans project was found and will be used instead.
MSG_UnknownProject=Unknown project type - it cannot be imported.
LABEL_Eclipse_Project=Eclipse Project
LABEL_NetBeans_Project_Destination=NetBeans Project Destination
TITLE_Synchronize_with_Eclipse=Synchronize with Eclipse
MSG_ProjectUpdateIssues=Project ''{0}'' update issues:
MSG_UpdateFailed=Update failed due to ''{0}''. More details can be found in the IDE's log file.
MSG_SelectProject=Eclipse project must be selected.
MSG_SelectWorkspace=Eclipse workspace must be selected.
TITLE_Select_Eclipse_Project=Select Eclipse Project
TITLE_Select_Eclipse_Workspace=Select Eclipse Workspace
MSG_CannotReadMyEclipseLibs=MyEclipse installation was not found and so its internal libraries were not imported to NetBeans.
MSG_SourceRootOwned=The Eclipse project ''{0}'' has a source root ({1}) which is already owned by an existing NetBeans project ''{2}''. The Eclipse project will not be imported and you should instead open the existing NetBeans project which manages the sources.
MSG_CannotFindLibrarySources=Source root ''{0}'' associated with library ''{1}'' cannot be found and will be ignored.
