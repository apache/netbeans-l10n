TXT_Notice=<html>Some browsers ( Chrome, Opera, etc. ) has security restrictions which do not allow to access remote (REST) resource from local filesystem.  In such a case one need to choose a project which will be deployed into the same domain and test client will be able to access REST resource. One can choose local filesystem target if your browser does not have security restrictions. In the latter case test client will be generated locally and will not be deployed to the J2EE server.</html>
