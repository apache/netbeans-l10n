PackageAIDPanel.aIDPanel1.title=Classic Package AID
PackageAIDPanel.jTextArea1.text=The Classic Package AID is a unique ID for the package of this classic applet or classic library JAR (such projects only contain one package).\n\nThe RID portion is a unique ID of your organization, assigned by a standards body such as the ISO (International Standards Organization).  It can be set for all new projects in Tools > Options > Miscellaneous > Java Card.\n\nThe PIX (proprietary identifier) simply uniquely identifies one Java package.  It is generated by the IDE and can be set as you wish.  No specific value is required for development purposes.
