Prend en charge la d\u00e9finition de mappages des cibles Ant vers les actions EDI, les emplacements des dossiers sources, l'organisation de la vue logique, etc.

# Actions
# The key name is "CMD_" followed by a constant from
# org.netbeans.spi.project.ActionProvider, org.netbeans.api.java.project.JavaProjectConstants
# or org.netbeans.modules.web.api.webmodule.WebProjectConstants.
# Only project-global actions (not context-sensitive actions like compile.single)
# need to be listed, since this is for the context menu of the project node.
# List should match that in Actions.COMMON_IDE_GLOBAL_ACTIONS + COMMON_NON_IDE_GLOBAL_ACTIONS.
