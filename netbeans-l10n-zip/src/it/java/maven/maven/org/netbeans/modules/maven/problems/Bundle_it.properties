ERR_SystemScope=A 'system' scope dependency was not found. Code completion is affected. 

MSG_SystemScope=There is a 'system' scoped dependency in the project but the path to the binary is not valid.\nPlease check that the path is absolute and points to an existing binary.

ERR_NonLocal=Some dependency artifacts are not in the local repository.

MSG_NonLocal=Your project has dependencies that are not resolved locally. Code completion in the IDE will not include classes from these dependencies or their transitive dependencies (unless they are among the open projects).\nPlease download the dependencies, or install them manually, if not available remotely.\n\nThe artifacts are\:\n {0}

ERR_NoParent=Parent POM file is not accessible. Project might be improperly setup.

MSG_NoParent=The parent POM with id {0}  was not found in sources or local repository. Please check that <relativePath> tag is present and correct, the version of parent POM in sources matches the version defined. \nIf parent is only available through a remote repository, please check that the repository hosting it is defined in the current POM.

ERR_MissingJ2eeModule=Maven J2EE support module missing
MSG_MissingJ2eeModule=You are missing the Maven J2EE support module in your installation. This means that all J2EE related functionality (for example, Deployment, File templates) is missing. The most probable cause is that part of the general J2EE support is missing as well. Please go to Tools/Plugins and install the plugins related to J2EE.

ERR_MissingApisupportModule=Maven NetBeans Development support module missing
MSG_MissingApisupportModule=You are missing the Maven APIsupport module in your installation. This means that all NetBeans development related functionality (for example, File templates, running platform application) is missing. The most probable cause is that part of the general API support is missing as well. Please go to Tools/Plugins and install the plugins related to NetBeans development.
